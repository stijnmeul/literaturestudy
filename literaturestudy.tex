\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{O}{nline} Social Networks (\textit{OSNs}) are increasingly being
used to share sensitive data with a limited circle of online connections. Users
therefore have to count on the privacy infrastructure of the social network
itself. On social networks like Google Plus or Facebook this is realised by
defining groups of connections who are allowed to see certain profile updates.
At first sight the user seems protected from the general public as it does not
have access to these shielded updates. The OSN itself however still has access
to this data and gratefully uses it for comercial purposes like targeted
advertising or behavior analysis. All this data forms the basis of the OSNs
economical existence. As recent events have shown, this user data is not
only used for the sake of the OSNs financial survival but the data is
 leaked to third parties and agencies like NSA as well. One can wonder if a
company non-transparently passes this data to any government agency for the
argument of security, what other purposes this data will be used for.\\
\\
Because the OSN has access to all users' data, it can be shared with external
parties. This takes the users' full control over their data completely out of
their hands. Additionally OSNs might offer API's to expose the users'
information to other services like external applications. Finally, OSNs
intentionally change security policies to maintain the balance between
usability and the commercial value of their databases thereby leaving their
users privacy behind.~\cite{BeatoScramble}\\
\\
One could argue that if one wants to stay anonymous, he should not use an OSN.
As the increasing popularity of OSNs has shown however, there is a market
demand for OSNs because of their wide range of useful applications. It would
therefore still be meaningful to make use of the infrastructure of a Social
Network without its inherent data leakage.\\
\\
The goal of this literature study is to research an elegant architecture that
allows to keep using OSN infrastructure without having to rely on the
willingness of OSNs to keep the user's data private. The study is done with
particularly Facebook in mind as this social network is amongst the most
popular ones in the world. In the end the user should be able to define his
own privacy instead of being dictated by the social network.



\section{Existing Architectures~\cite{BeatoScramble}}
Lots of fundamental work has been done on applications trying to enforce
access control rules on OSNs. A grasp of all available applications is
listed and analysed in the following section.

\paragraph{flyByNight} is a Facebook application that protects user data by
storing it in encrypted form in Facebook. It relies on Facebook servers for its
key management and is therefore not secure against active attacks by Facebook
itself.

\paragraph{NOYB (None Of Your Business)} replaces the details of user A with
those of random users B and C thereby making this process only reversable by
friends who are allowed to see the profile of user A. However this can not be
applied to messages or status updates that are frequently used on Facebook.

\paragraph{FaceCloak} stores published Facebook data on its servers in encrypted
form and replaces the data on Facebook with random text fetched from Wikipedia.
Although this could be a useful mechanism to prevent OSNs from blocking security
aware users because they are scared to see their advertising revenues shrink, it
has the disadvantage that other users could take this data to be genuine user
content. Furthermore FaceCloaks architecture leads to an inefficient key
distribution system.

\paragraph{Persona} is a scheme that can be used as a Firefox extension to let
users of an OSN determine their own privacy by supporting the ability to encrypt
messages to a group of earlier defined friends based on \textit{attribute-based
encryption (ABE)}\cite{SahaiFuzzyIBE}. The scheme supports lots of useful use
cases such as sending messages to all friends that are related to a certain
attribute or even encrypting messages to friends of friends. The major drawback
of this system however is that every new friend has to exchange a public key
before he is able to interact in the privacy preserving architecture
consequently requiring an infrastructure for broadcasting and storing public
keys. Furthermore, to support the encryption of messages to friends of friends,
user defined groups should be made available publicly thereby making the public
key distribution system even more complicated. Finally the proposed ABE
encryption scheme is 100 to 1000 times slower than a standard RSA operation.
\cite{BadenPersona} 

\paragraph{Scramble} is a Firefox extension that allows defining groups of
friends that are given access to certain social network updates. The tool uses
public key encryption based on OpenPGP \cite{rfc4880} to broadcast encrypted
messages on almost any platform. Furthermore Scramble provides the
implementation of a tiny link server such that OSN policies not allowing to post
encrypted data are bypassed. However, as indicated by usability studies
\cite{WhittenJohnny} OpenPGP has a higher usage threshold because an average
user does not mannage to understand OpenPGP properly. Additionally Scramble has
to rely on the security decisions of the web of thrust. It therefore inherits
the upleasant property of OpenPGP that the user can not be sure that the used
PGP key actually belongs to the intended Facebook profile.\cite{BeatoScramble}\\
\\
The most unattractive property of all the above applications is that they have
to rely on a rather complex infrastructure. Persona has to support an extended
public key distribution system and Scramble relies on the leap-of-faith PGP web
of thrust. Would it not be pleasant to use an infrastructure that inherently
ensures that a Facebook update can only be read by the profiles the user
inteded to? Would it not be a desirable approach that Facebook would require
users to publish a public key on their Facebook profile such that communication
with external providers is limited to a minimum? As the most important part of
an OSNs revenues lies in the data analysis of their users, the chances of
Facebook implementing a required public key option are rather low to
unexisting. To circumvent the requirement of such a public key attribute, it
would be user friendly if any unique public string could be used as a public
key. This is where identity based cryptography comes in.\\
\\
\section{Identity Based Encryption}
Shamir proposed a concept of identity-based cryptography in
1984~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/Shamir84}. The basic idea behind identity-based
cryptography is that any string can be a valid public key. Identity-based
cryptography is particularly elegant if the public key is related to an
attribute that uniquely identifies the identity of the user like an e-mail
address or a telephone number~\cite{Baek04asurvey}.

% For figures, \caption

% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.

% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the

% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
